# Supply-Chain-Optimization-Project
A Python-based project that models and solves a supply chain optimization problem using linear programming. It minimizes transportation costs between plants, warehouses, and retailers, with data-driven decision-making and clear visualizations.

The goal of this project is to minimize the total cost of shipping products from plants to warehouses to retailers. The solution involves:
Reading and cleaning raw data,
Constructing a linear programming (LP) model,
Applying constraints such as supply, demand, and capacity,
Solving the LP model using the PuLP optimization library,
Visualizing results with charts and maps.

Features:
Cost optimization across multiple supply chain stages,
Flexibility to adjust input data (e.g., costs, capacities, demands),
Easily interpretable outputs and visual charts,
Suitable for educational, research, or prototype-level use.
